Reviewer expertise

2. Some familiarity

Strengths
---------
Detailed in-depth research across the aspects, ideas, thoughts and observations from the involuntary celibacy (incels) community point of view.

A Straightforward paper on an off-beat research topic on Manosphere and Incels, bringing up the controversial issue in public domain, is a great effort which requires a lot of networking, discussion, observations and a lot of evidence gathering.

Weaknesses
----------
The paper could have some charts, visualizations to support the facts and hypothesis and make the studies easier to understand.
While the theoretical data collected and research was large enough, the paper lacked numerical data and statistics to support the points, facts and statements made
